# Python Basics Repository

This repository contains a structured introduction to core Python programming concepts. Each folder introduces a specific topic with example code and explanations.

## 📁 01_setup
This section covers the initial setup required for running Python. It includes:
- Instructions on installing Python
- Setting up a virtual environment
- Recommended tools and editors

## 📁 02_python_syntax
An overview of Python's basic syntax. Topics include:
- Indentation and code blocks
- Comments
- Printing output
- Basic input/output operations

## 📁 03_variables
This folder explains how to work with variables in Python, including:
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Naming conventions
- Dynamic typing

## 📁 04_typecasting
Covers how to convert data from one type to another in Python. Includes:
- Implicit vs explicit typecasting
- Common type conversion functions (`int()`, `str()`, `float()`, etc.)

## 📁 05_user_input  
Focuses on getting input from users during program execution. Topics include:  
- Using the `input()` function  
- Reading and storing user input  
- Type conversion of input data  
- Simple interactive programs

## 📁 06_comments_print_esc
This section focuses on comments, the `print()` function, and escape sequences in Python. It includes:
- Single-line and multi-line comments
- The `print()` function syntax and usage
- Using `sep` and `end` parameters in `print()`
- Common escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`, etc.)

## 📁 07_operators
Introduces different types of operators available in Python. Topics include:
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`)
- Operator precedence and associativity

## 📁 08_control_flow_loops
This section introduces control flow and looping constructs in Python, helping you write programs that make decisions and repeat tasks. Topics include:
- **If-Else Conditional Statements**: Making decisions in code with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **Match Case Statements**: A cleaner alternative to multiple `if-elif` blocks (introduced in Python 3.10).
- **For Loops**: Iterating over sequences such as lists, strings, and ranges.
- **While Loops**: Repeating a block of code until a condition is met.
- **Break, Continue, and Pass Statements**: Controlling loop execution flow.
