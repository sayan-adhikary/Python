# Python Basics Repository

This repository contains a structured introduction to core Python programming concepts. Each folder introduces a specific topic with example code and explanations.

## 📁 01_setup
This section covers the initial setup required for running Python. It includes:
- Instructions on installing Python
- Setting up a virtual environment
- Recommended tools and editors

## 📁 02_python_syntax
An overview of Python's basic syntax. Topics include:
- Indentation and code blocks
- Comments
- Printing output
- Basic input/output operations

## 📁 03_variables
This folder explains how to work with variables in Python, including:
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Naming conventions
- Dynamic typing

## 📁 04_typecasting
Covers how to convert data from one type to another in Python. Includes:
- Implicit vs explicit typecasting
- Common type conversion functions (`int()`, `str()`, `float()`, etc.)

## 📁 05_user_input  
Focuses on getting input from users during program execution. Topics include:  
- Using the `input()` function  
- Reading and storing user input  
- Type conversion of input data  
- Simple interactive programs

## 📁 06_comments_print_esc
This section focuses on comments, the `print()` function, and escape sequences in Python. It includes:
- Single-line and multi-line comments
- The `print()` function syntax and usage
- Using `sep` and `end` parameters in `print()`
- Common escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`, etc.)

## 📁 07_operators
Introduces different types of operators available in Python. Topics include:
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`)
- Operator precedence and associativity

## 📁 08_conditional
This section covers conditional statements in Python, which allow programs to make decisions based on conditions. It includes:
- **If Statement** – Executing code only when a condition is true
- **If-Else Statement** – Handling both true and false conditions
- **If-Elif-Else Statement** – Checking multiple conditions in sequence
- **Match-Case Statement** – A structured alternative to multiple if-elif blocks (introduced in Python 3.10)

## 📁 09_loops
This section introduces looping constructs in Python, which allow repeating tasks efficiently. It includes:
- **For Loops** – Iterating over sequences like lists, strings, and ranges
- **While Loops** – Running code repeatedly while a condition is true
- **Infinite Loops** – Loops that run indefinitely until manually stopped
- **Break Statement** – Exiting a loop prematurely
- **Continue Statement** – Skipping the current iteration and continuing with the next
- **Pass Statement** – A placeholder statement that does nothing, often used for code structure

## 📁 10_string
This section covers working with strings in Python, one of the most commonly used data types. It includes:
- **String Basics** – Creating and using strings
- **Indexing** – Accessing individual characters in a string
- **Slicing** – Extracting parts of a string using slice notation
- **String Methods** – Built-in methods for string manipulation (e.g., `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, etc.)
- **F-Strings** – Formatting strings efficiently using f-string syntax
